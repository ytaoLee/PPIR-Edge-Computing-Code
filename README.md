# Privacy-Preserving Image Retrieval with Deep Learning in Edge Computing

This project implements the privacy-preserving image retrieval system proposed in the paper "Privacy-Preserving Image Retrieval with Deep Learning in Edge Computing".

## Key Features

- Dynamic Multi-Stage Encryption (DMSE): Provides block-level, channel-level, and pixel-level encryption
- Multi-Scale Feature Extraction: Combines global DCT features with local convolutional features
- Vision Transformer Feature Fusion: Effectively fuses global and local features
- Edge Computing Friendly: Designed with consideration for the computational limitations of edge devices

## Installation Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
